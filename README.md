# ResourcePackExtractor

**ResourcePackExtractor** is a Fabric mod (1.21.8) based on [MineCraft Resource Pack eXtractor (MCRPX)](https://github.com/Speedy11CZ/MCRPX).  
It allows you to extract server resource packs directly in-game.

Unlike normal unpacking, this mod can also bypass corrupted resource packs, which are often used by servers to protect their packs.
